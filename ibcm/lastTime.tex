    \item open addressing
        \begin{itemize}
            \item instead of chaining (linked list) search index + $f(1)$, + $f(2)$, \ldots
            \item $f(i) = i$ --- linear probing --- has clumping
            \item $f(i) = i^2$ --- quadratic probing
            \item $f(i) = i h_2(k)$ --- double hashing
        \end{itemize} 
    \item prime sizes --- avoid thrashing (double-hashing), better for not-great hash functions
    \item cryptographic hash functions (e.g. SHA-256, MD5)
        \begin{itemize}
        \item had goals of security properties
        \end{itemize}
    \hrule
    \item started machine code and assembly
    \end{itemize}
