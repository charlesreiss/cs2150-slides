\begin{itemize}
\item calling convention is about:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item what registers change
    \item what parts of the stack change
    \item where arguments/return values are
    \end{itemize}
\item it says what you \textit{can} do and \textit{can} rely on functions doing for you
    \begin{itemize}
    \item but there are many ways to comply with it
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{calling convention doesn't say\ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item you have to store local variables on the stack
    \begin{itemize}
    \item though that's an easy, correct thing to do
    \end{itemize}
\item which register you need to use for a variable/temporary
    \begin{itemize}
    \item as long as you save it, if needed
    \end{itemize}
\item when you allocate space on the stack
    \begin{itemize}
    \item as long as you free it before returning\ldots
