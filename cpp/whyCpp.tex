\begin{frame}{why C++?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item easier to talk about data representation
    \item ``closer to the hardware''
        \begin{itemize}
        \item directly allocate memory
        \item more obvious translation to assembly/machine code
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{why not C++?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item some not great syntax choices
    \item made in 1980s, standardized in 1990s--2010s
    \item based on C (1970s, standardized in 1980s)
    \item makes compromises for compatibility with C
    \end{itemize}
