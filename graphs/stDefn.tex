\begin{frame}{spanning tree definition}
\begin{itemize}
\item given a connected graph $G$, a spanning tree $G'=(V,E')$ is a \textit{subgraph} such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item its edges are a subset of the original graph's (what \textit{subgraph} means)
\item it has the same vertices
\item it is connected
\item it has no cycles --- i.e. it is a tree
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{spanning tree construction}
\begin{itemize}
\item take a connected graph
\item repeatedly: remove an edge that does not disconnect the graph
\item can't remove any more: a spanning tree --- same vertices, but is a tree
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
