\begin{frame}{breadth-first search is greedy}
\begin{itemize}
\item greedy algorithms: make the locally optimal choice, never undo
\item BFS: once one finds a node, one enqueues it once
\begin{itemize}
\item find the node later --- skip it
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item why this is okay: \myemph{find nodes in order of distance}
\item second time `visiting' a node --- won't be a shorter path!
\end{itemize}
