\begin{frame}{travelling salesperson problem}
\begin{itemize}
\item given cities, costs to travel between, least-cost trip that:
\begin{itemize}
\item visits each city exactly once, and
\item returns to the starting city
\end{itemize}
\item as a graph:
\begin{itemize}
\item cities = vertices
\item costs = edge weights
\end{itemize}
\item assume fully connected graph
\begin{itemize}
\item alternative: first add infinite weight edges between disconnected nodes
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{TSP difficulty}
\begin{itemize}
\item solving TSP exactly is NP-hard
\vspace{.5cm}
\item worst case: essentially need to enumerate all possible tours
\hrule
\item but, practically solved up to 10000s of cities on `real' maps
\begin{itemize}
\item obviously doing something smarter\ldots
