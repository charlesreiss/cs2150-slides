\begin{frame}{graph summary (1)}
\begin{itemize}
\item directed (digraph) versus undirected
\item topological sort --- ordering of vertices in digraph
    \begin{itemize}
    \item intuition: find vertex w/ no in-edge, delete
    \end{itemize}
\item shortest path --- minimum edges from one vertex to another
    \begin{itemize}
    \item unweighted: breadth-first search --- queue --- distance 1 then 2 then 3
    \item weighted: Dijkstra's --- priority queue --- visit veritices ordered by best distance
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{graphs summary (2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item traveling salesperson problem --- minimum `tour' --- visit all, then return
    \begin{itemize}
    \item NP-hard --- essentially ``try everything'' worst case
    \item speedup: stop search early if not better than known best
    \item speedup: avoid rechecking subproblems (e.g. shortest path from A to D visiting A,B,C,D)
    \item speedup: heuristics
    \end{itemize}
\item spanning tree --- tree (no cycles) connecting all vertices of connected graph
\item minimum spanning tree --- spanning tree with min sum of edge weights
    \begin{itemize}
    \item finding: greedy --- choose smallest edges first
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
