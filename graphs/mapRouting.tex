\begin{frame}{single-source to single-source+destination}
\begin{itemize}
\item what if want to get from $A$ to $Z$
\item solution: Dijkstra's algorithm from $A$ but stop early --- when we proesss $Z$
\item gaurentee: won't update $Z$'s distance again
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{heuristic shortest path}
\begin{itemize}
\item road map --- still slow!
\item some ideas for speeding up:
\begin{itemize}
\item search highways instead of side-roads earlier
\item search edges in correct direction earlier
\item search from both directions, try to meet
\item \ldots
\end{itemize}
\item if you take AI --- major topic is \textit{heuristic search}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item taking advantage of ideas like the above
    \item \ldots and still getting shortest path, if you want it
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
