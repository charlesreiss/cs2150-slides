\begin{frame}{negative weights}
\begin{itemize}
\item example: weight = fuel used; negative weight = refueling
\item Dijkstra's algorithm \myemph{doesn't work}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item assumption: won't update a node's distance after visiting its edges
    \end{itemize}
\item alternative algorithms do --- e.g. Bellman-Ford ($\Theta(|E||V|)$ runtime)
\vspace{.5cm}
\item negative cost cycles --- infinitely small cost!
\end{itemize}
