    \item Huffman decoding --- construct + follow tree
    \item Huffman lab format, etc. reminders
        \begin{itemize}
        \item printable ASCII only --- 0x20 to 0x7e
        \end{itemize}
    \item graph definitions
        \begin{itemize}
        \item directed v undirected
        \item paths and cycles
        \item connected (undirected), weakly connected and strongly conneted (directed)
        \end{itemize}
    \item graph representations and their pros/cons
        \begin{itemize}
        \item adjacency matrix --- entry for every pair, no lists
        \item adjacency lists --- list for every vertex
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item topological sort
        \begin{itemize}
            \item intuition: find first node (no incoming edges), remove, repeat
            \item fast implementation: track in-degrees only, enqueue as indegree decremented to 0
        \end{itemize}
    \item shortest path: breadth first search
        \begin{itemize}
        \item use edges to find distance 1 nodes, use edges from those to find distance 2 nodes, etc.
        \item analogy to pre-order: still parents then children, but all parents at level $x$ then children
        \item extra tracking: don't `visit' node twice
        \end{itemize}
    \item representing shortest paths: shortest path tree
        \begin{itemize}
        \item only need edge from each node towards source
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
