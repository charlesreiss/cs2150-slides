\begin{frame}{connectivity}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{connected graph}: for all $x, y  \in V$, there exists a path from $x$ to $y$
    \begin{itemize}
    \item N.B: includes 0-length paths
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{in a directed graph\ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{DAG} --- directed acyclic graph
    \begin{itemize}
    \item no cycles
    \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{strongly connected} --- path from every vertex to every other
    \begin{itemize}
    \item implies cycles (or digraph of 0 or 1 nodes)
    \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{weakly connected} --- would be connected as undirected graph
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
