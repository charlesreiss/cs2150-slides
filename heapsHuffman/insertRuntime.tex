    \item worst case: $\log_2 N$ nodes changed

\begin{frame}{insert average case?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item average case is better assuming random keys:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item intuition: leafs have bottom half of values (on average)
        \item \ldots so usually don't need to move up
        \item \ldots and if we do, parents of leafs have 25th to 50th percentile of values
        \item \ldots so need to move up two steps even less
        \item about 2 steps moved up on average
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
