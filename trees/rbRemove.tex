\begin{frame}{RB-tree: removal}
\begin{itemize}
\item start with normal BST remove of $x$, but\ldots
\item instead find next highest/lowest node $y$
    \begin{itemize}
    \item can choose node \textit{with at most one child} \\
            (``bottom'' of a left or right subtree)
    \end{itemize}
\item swap $x$ and $y$'s value, then replace $y$ with its child
\vspace{.5cm}
\item several cases for color maintainence/rotations
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RB tree: removal cases}
\begin{itemize}
\item N: node just replaced with child; S: its sibling; P: its parent
\vspace{.5cm}
\item (1): N is new root
\item (2): S is \nred{red}
\item (3): P, S, and S's children are \nblack{black}
\item (4): S and S's children are \nblack{black}
\item (5): S is \nblack{black}, S's left child is \nred{red}, S's right child is \nblack{black}, N is left child of P
\item (6): S is \nblack{black}, S's right child is \nblack{red}, N is left child
